    "## Is LQR the answer for everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, no. LQR is great for problems with true quadratic costs and linear dynamics, but this is a very small subset of convex trajectory optimization problems. While a quadratic cost is common in control, there are other available convex cost functions that may better motivate the desired behavior of the system. These costs can be things like an L1 norm on the control inputs ($\\|u\\|_1$), or an L2 goal error ($\\|x - x_{goal}\\|_2$). Also, control problems often have constraints like path constraints, control bounds, or terminal constraints, that can't be handled with LQR. With the addition of these constraints, the trajectory optimization problem is stil convex and easy to solve, but we can no longer just get an optimal gain $K$ and apply a feedback policy in these situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this is Model Predictive Control (MPC). In MPC, we are setting up and solving a convex trajectory optimization at every time step, optimizing over some horizon or window into the future, and executing the first control in the solution. To see how this works, we are going to try this for a classic space control problem: the rendezvous. "

    "\n",
    "In part C, we solved for the optimal rendezvous trajectory using convex optimization, and verified it by simulating it in an open loop fashion (no feedback). This was made possible because we assumed that our linear dynamics were exact, and that we had a perfect estimate of our state. In reality, there are many issues that would prevent this open loop policy from being successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these factors result in a \"sim to real\" gap between our simulated model, and the real model. Because there will always be a sim to real gap, we can't just execute open loop policies and expect them to be successful. What we can do, however, is use Model Predictive Control (MPC) that combines some of the ideas of feedback control with convex trajectory optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "A convex MPC controller will set up and solve a convex optimization problem at each time step that incorporates the current state estimate as an initial condition. For a trajectory tracking problem like this rendezvous, we want to track $x_{ref}$, but instead of optimizing over the whole trajectory, we will only consider a sliding window of size $N_{mpc}$ (also called a horizon). If $N_{mpc} = 20$, this means our convex MPC controller is reasoning about the next 20 steps in the trajectory. This optimization problem at every timestep will start by taking the relevant reference trajectory at the current window from the current step $i$, to the end of the window $i + N_{mpc} - 1$. This slice of the reference trajectory that applies to the current MPC window will be called $\\tilde{x}_{ref} = x_{ref}[i,(i + N_{mpc} - 1)]$.\n",

    "where $N$ in this case is $N_{mpc}$. This allows for the MPC controller to \"think\" about the future states in a way that the LQR controller cannot. By updating the reference trajectory window ($\\tilde{x}_{ref}$) at each step and updating the initial condition ($x_{IC}$), the MPC controller is able to \"react\" and compensate for the sim to real gap. \n",
